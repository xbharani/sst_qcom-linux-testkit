# Qualcomm UserDataEncryption Functionality Test Script
## Overview

The `UserDataEncryption` test script verifies basic filesystem encryption functionality. It generates a 64-byte key, adds it to the system, applies an encryption policy to a mount directory, and confirms the setup by creating and reading a test file. This ensures that key management and encryption policies work as expected.

## Features

- **Dependency Check**: Verifies the presence of the `fscryptctl` binary.
- **Key Management**: Generates a 64-byte key and adds it to the filesystem.
- **Encryption Policy**: Applies and verifies encryption policy on a mount directory.
- **Functional Validation**: Creates and reads a test file to confirm encryption functionality.
- **Automated Result Logging**: Outputs test results to a `.res` file for automated result collection.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following components are present on the target device:

- `fscryptctl` binary is available
- Sufficient permissions to create and mount directories

## Directory Structure
```
Runner/
├── suites/
│   ├── Kernel/
│   │   │   ├── Baseport/
│   │   │   │   ├── UserDataEncryption/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── run.sh
```
## Usage

1. Copy repo to Target Device: Use scp to transfer the scripts from the host to the target device. The scripts should be copied to the ```/<user-defined-location>``` directory on the target device.

2. Verify Transfer: Ensure that the repo have been successfully copied to the ```/<user-defined-location>``` directory on the target device.

3. Run Scripts: Navigate to the ```/<user-defined-location>``` directory on the target device and execute the scripts as needed.

Quick Example
```
git clone <this-repo>
cd <this-repo>
scp -r common Runner user@target_device_ip:/<user-defined-location>
ssh user@target_device_ip 
cd /<user-defined-location>/Runner && ./run-test.sh UserDataEncryption

Sample output:
sh-5.2# ./run-test.sh UserDataEncryption

4. Results will be available in the `/<user-defined-location>/Runner/suites/Kernel/Baseport/UserDataEncryption/` directory.

## Notes

- The script uses /mnt as the base directory (with /UDE as a fallback) for all operations.
- Temporary files such as the encryption key are cleaned up after the test.
- If any test fails, the script logs the error and exits with a failure code.
